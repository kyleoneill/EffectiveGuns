# Effective Guns

Effective Guns is a [Rimworld](https://rimworldgame.com/) mod that adds weapons which utilize Rimworld's bullet status effect system.

Currently, three new guns are added. All three are similar to the Assault Rifle with some modifications

1. EMP Assault Rifle - Bullets have a chance to stun mechanical enemies. This is compatible with mechs added in the popular Alpha Animals mod.
2. Bomb Assault Rifle - Bullets have a chance to explode upon impact. This gun is imbalanced and fun!
3. Burn Assault Rifle - Bullets have a chance to cause burn damage upon impact.
